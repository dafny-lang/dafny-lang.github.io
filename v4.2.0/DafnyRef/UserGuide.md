# 13. Dafny User's Guide {#sec-user-guide}

Most of this document describes the Dafny programming language.
This section describes the `dafny` tool, a combined verifier and compiler
that implements the Dafny language.

The development of the Dafny language and tool is a GitHub project at [https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny).
The project is open source, with collaborators from various organizations; additional contributors are welcome.
The software itself is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

## 13.1. Introduction

The `dafny` tool implements the following primary capabilities, implemented as various [_commands_](#sec-dafny-commands) within the `dafny` tool:

- checking that the input files represent a valid Dafny program (i.e., syntax, grammar and name and type resolution);
- verifying that the program meets its specifications, by translating the program to verification conditions
and checking those with Boogie and an SMT solver, typically Z3;
- compiling the program to a target language, such as C#, Java, Javascript, Go (and others in development);
- running the executable produced by the compiler.

In addition there are a variety of other capabilities, such as formatting files, also implemented as commands;
more such commands are expected in the future.

## 13.2. Installing Dafny

### 13.2.1. Command-line tools

The instructions for installing `dafny` and the required dependencies and environment
are described on the Dafny wiki:
[https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/wiki/INSTALL](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/wiki/INSTALL).
They are not repeated here to avoid replicating information that
easily becomes inconsistent and out of date.
The dafny tool can also be installed using `dotnet tool install --global dafny`
(presuming that `dotnet` is already installed on your system).

Most users will find it most convenient to install the pre-built Dafny binaries available on the project release site or using the `dotnet` CLI.
As is typical for Open Source projects, dafny can also be built directly from the source files maintained in the github project.

Current and past Dafny binary releases can be found at
[https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/releases](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/releases) for each supported platform.
Each release is a .zip file with a name combining the release name and the
platform. Current platforms are Windows 11, Ubuntu 20 and later, and MacOS 10.14 and later.

The dafny tool is distributed as a standalone executable. 
A compatible version of the required Z3 solver is included in the release.
There are additional dependencies that are needed to compile dafny to particular target languages,
as described in the release instructions.
A development environment to _build_ dafny from source requires additional dependencies, 
described [here](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/wiki/INSTALL#building-and-developing-from-source-code).


### 13.2.2. IDEs for Dafny {#sec-ides}

Dafny source files are text files and can of course be edited with any
text editor. However, some tools provide syntax-aware features:

- VSCode, a cross-platform editor for many programming languages has an extension for Dafny. 
  VSCode is available [here](http://code.visualstudio.com) and the Dafny extension can be installed from within VSCode.
  The [extension](#sec-dafny-language-server-vscode) provides syntax highlighting, in-line parser,
  type and verification errors, code navigation, counter-example display and gutter highlights.
- There is a [Dafny mode for
    Emacs](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie-friends).
- An old Visual Studio plugin is no longer supported

Information about installing IDE extensions for Dafny is found
on the [Dafny INSTALL page in the wiki](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/wiki/INSTALL).

More information about using VSCode IDE is [here](#sec-dafny-language-server-vscode).

## 13.3. Dafny Programs and Files

A Dafny program is a set of modules.
Modules can refer to other modules, such as through `import` declarations
or `refines` clauses.
A Dafny program consists of all the modules needed so that all module
references are resolved.
Dafny programs are contained in files that have a `.dfy` suffix.
Such files each hold
some number of top-level declarations. Thus a full program may be
distributed among multiple files.
To apply the `dafny` tool to a Dafny program, the `dafny` tool must be
given all the files making up a complete program (or, possibly, more than
one program at a time). This can be effected either by listing all of the files
by name on the command-line or by using `include` directives within a file
to stipulate what other files contain modules that the given files need.
Thus the complete set of modules are all the modules in all the files listed
on the command-line or referenced, recursively, by `include` directives
within those files. It does not matter if files are repeated either as
includes or on the command-line.[^fn-duplicate-files]

All files recursively included are always parsed and type-checked.
However, which files are verified, built, run, or processed by other
dafny commands depends on the individual command. 
These commands are described in [Section 13.5.1](#sec-dafny-commands).

[^fn-duplicate-files]: Files may be included more than once or both included and listed on the command line. Duplicate inclusions are detected and each file processed only once.
For the purpose of detecting duplicates, file names are considered equal if they have the same absolute path, compared as case-sensitive strings (regardless of whether the underlying file-system is case sensitive).  Using symbolic links may make the same file have a different absolute path; this will generally cause duplicate declaration errors.

### 13.3.1. Dafny Build Artifacts: the Library Backend and .doo Files {#sec-doo-files}

As of Dafny 4.1, `dafny` now supports outputting a single file containing
a fully-verified program along with metadata about how it was verified.
Such files use the extension `.doo`, for Dafny Output Object,
and can be used as input anywhere a `.dfy` file can be.

`.doo` files are produced by an additional backend called the "Dafny Library" backend,
identified with the name `lib` on the command line. For example, to build multiple
Dafny files into a single build artifact for shared reuse, the command would look something like:

```bash
dafny build -t:lib A.dfy B.dfy C.dfy --output:MyLib.doo
```

The Dafny code contained in a `.doo` file is not re-verified when passed back to the `dafny` tool,
just as included files and those passed with the `--library` option are not.
Using `.doo` files provides a guarantee that the Dafny code was in fact verified,
however, and therefore offers protection against build system mistakes.
`.doo` files are therefore ideal for sharing Dafny libraries between projects.

`.doo` files also contain metadata about the version of Dafny used to verify them
and the values of relevant options that affect the sound separate verification and
compilation of Dafny code, such as `--unicode-char`.
This means attempting to use a library that was built with options
that are not compatible with the currently executing command options
will lead to errors.
This also includes attempting to use a `.doo` file built with a different version of Dafny,
although this restriction may be lifted in the future.

A `.doo` file is a compressed archive of multiple files, similar to the `.jar` file format for Java packages.
The exact file format is internal and may evolve over time to support additional features.

Note that the library backend only supports the [newer command-style CLI interface](#sec-dafny-commands).

## 13.4. Dafny Code Style

There are coding style conventions for Dafny code, recorded [here](https://dafny-lang.github.io/dafny/StyleGuide/Style-Guide).
Most significantly, code is written without tabs and with a 2 space indentation. Following code style conventions 
improves readability but does not alter program semantics.



## 13.5. Using Dafny From the Command Line {#command-line}

`dafny` is a conventional command-line tool, operating just like other
command-line tools in Windows and Unix-like systems.
In general, the format of a command-line is determined by the shell program that is executing the command-line 
(.e.g., bash, the windows shell, COMMAND, etc.), 
but is expected to be a series of space-separated "words", each representing a command, option, option argument, file, or folder. 

### 13.5.1. dafny commands {#sec-dafny-commands}

As of v3.9.0, `dafny` uses a command-style command-line (like `git` for example); prior to v3.9.0, the 
command line consisted only of options and files.
It is expected that additional commands will be added in the future.
Each command may have its own subcommands and its own options, in addition to generally applicable options. 
Thus the format of the command-line is
a command name, followed by options and files:
`dafny <command> <options> <files>`;
the command-name must be the first command-line argument.

The command-line `dafny --help` or `dafny -h` lists all the available commands.

The command-line `dafny <command> --help` (or `-h` or `-?`) gives help information for that particular \<command\>, including the list of options.
Some options for a particular command are intended only for internal tool development; those are shown using the `--help-internal` option instead of `--help`.

Also, the command-style command-line has modernized the syntax of options; they are now POSIX-compliant.
Like many other tools, options now typically begin with a double hyphen, 
with some options having a single-hyphen short form, such as `--help` and `-h`.
 
If no \<command\> is given, then the command-line is presumed to use old-style syntax, so any previously 
written command-line will still be valid.

`dafny` recognizes the commands described in the following subsections. The most commonly used
are [`dafny verify`](#sec-dafny-verify), [`dafny build`](#sec-dafny-build), and [`dafny run`](#sec-dafny-run).

The command-line also expects the following:
- Files are designated by absolute paths or paths relative to the current
working directory. A command-line argument not matching a known option is considered a filepath, and likely one
with an unsupported suffix, provoking an error message.
- Files containing dafny code must have a `.dfy` suffix.
- There must be at least one `.dfy` file (except when using `--stdin` or in the case of `dafny format`, see the [Dafny format section](#sec-dafny-format)) 
- The command-line may contain other kinds of files appropriate to
the language that the Dafny files are being compiled to. The kind of file is determined by its suffix.
- Escape characters are determined by the shell executing the command-line.
- Per POSIX convention, the option `--` means that all subsequent command-line arguments are not options to the dafny tool; they are either files or arguments to the `dafny run` command.
- If an option is repeated (e.g., with a different argument), then the later instance on the command-line supersedes the earlier instance, with just a few options accumulating arguments.
- If an option takes an argument, the option name is followed by a `:` or `=` or whitespace and then by the argument value; if the argument itself contains white space, the argument must be enclosed in quotes. It is recommended to use the `:` or `=` style to avoid misinterpretation or separation of a value from its option.
- Boolean options can take the values `true` and `false` (or any case-insensitive version of those words). For example, the value of `--no-verify` is by default `false` (that is, do verification). 
It can be explicitly set to true (no verification) using `--no-verify`, `--no-verify:true`, `--no-verify=true`, `--noverify true`; 
it can be explicitly set false (do verification) using `--no-verify:false` or `--no-verify=false` or `--no-verify false`.
- There is a potential ambiguity when the form `--option value` is used if the value is optional (such as for boolean values). In such a case an argument afer an option (that does not have an argument given with `:` or `=`) is interpreted as the value if it is indeed a valid value for that option. However, better style advises always using a ':' or '=' to set option values.
No valid option values in dafny look like filenames or begin with `--`.

#### 13.5.1.1. Options that are not associated with a command

A few options are not part of a command. In these cases any single-hyphen spelling also permits a spelling beginning with '/'.
- `dafny --help` or `dafny -h` lists all the available commands
- `dafny -?` or `dafny -help` list all legacy options
- `dafny --version` (or `-version`) prints out the number of the version this build of dafny implements


#### 13.5.1.2. `dafny resolve` {#sec-dafny-resolve}

The `dafny resolve` command checks the command-line and then parses and typechecks the given files and any included files.

The set of files considered by `dafny` are those listed on the command-line,
including those named in a `--library` option, and all files that are
named, recursively, in `include` directives in files in the set being considered by the tool.

The set of files presented to an invocation of the `dafny` tool must 
contain all the declarations needed to resolve all names and types, 
else name or type resolution errors will be emitted.

`dafny` can parse and verify sets of files that do not form a 
complete program because they are missing the implementations of 
some constructs such as functions, lemmas, and loop bodies.[^incomplete]
However, `dafny` will need all implementations in order to compile a working executable.

[^incomplete]: Unlike some languages, Dafny does not allow separation of 
declaration and implementation of methods, functions and types in separate files, nor, for that matter,
separation of specification and declaration. Implementations can be 
omitted simply by leaving them out of the declaration (or a lemma, for example).
However, a combination of [`traits`](#sec-trait-types) and
[`classes`](#sec-class-types) can achieve a separation of interface
and specification from
implementation.

The options relevant to this command are
- those relevant to the command-line itself
   - `--warn-as-errors` --- turn all warnings into errors, which alters [dafny's exit code](#sec-exit-codes)

- those that affect dafny` as a whole, such as
   - `--cores` --- set the number of cores dafny should use
   - `--show-snippets` --- emit a line or so of source code along with an error message
   - `--library` --- include this file in the program, but do not verify or compile it (multiple such library files can be listed using multiple instances of the `--library` option)
   - `--stdin` -- read from standard input
- those that affect the syntax of Dafny, such as
   - `--prelude`
   - `--unicode-char`
   - `--function-syntax` <version>
   - `--quantifier-syntax` <version>
   - `--track-print-effects`
   - `--warn-shadowing`
   - `--warn-missing-constructor-parentheses`


#### 13.5.1.3. `dafny verify` {#sec-dafny-verify}

The `dafny verify` command performs the [`dafny resolve`](#sec-dafny-resolve) checks and then attempts to verify each declaration in the program.

A guide to controlling and aiding the verification process is given in [a later section](#sec-verification).

To be considered _verified_ all the methods in all the files in a program must be verified, with consistent sets of options,
and with no unproven assumptions (see [`dafny audit`](#sec-dafny-audit) for a tool to help identify such assumptions).

Dafny works _modularly_, meaning that each method is considered by itself, using only the specifications of other methods.
So, when using the dafny tool, you can verify the program all at once or one file at a time or groups of files at a time.
On a large program, verifying all files at once can take quite a while, with little feedback as to progress, though it does
save a small amount of work by parsing all files just once. But, one way or another, to have a complete verification, all 
implementations of all methods and functions must eventually be verified.

- By default, only those files listed on the command-line are verified in a given invocation of the `dafny` tool.
- The option `--verify-included-files` (`-verifyAllModules` in legacy mode) forces the contents of all non-library files to be verified, whether they are listed on the command-line or recursively included by files on the command-line.
- The `--library` option marks files that are excluded from `--verify-included-files`. Such a file may also, but need not, be the target of an `include` directive in some file of the program; in any case, such files are included in the program but not in the set of files verified (or compiled). The intent of this option is to mark files that
should be considered as libraries that are independently verified prior to being released for shared use.
- Verifying files individually is equivalent to verifying them in groups, presuming no other changes.
It is also permitted to verify completely disjoint files or
programs together in a single run of `dafny`.

Various options control the verification process, in addition to all those described for [`dafny resolve`](#sec-dafny-resolve).

- What is verified
   - `--verify-included-files` (when enabled, all included files are verified, except library files, otherwise just those files on the command-line)
   - `--relax-definite-assignment`
   - `--track-print-effects`
   - `--disable-nonlinear-arithmetic`

- Control of the proof engine
   - `--manual-lemma-induction`
   - `--verification-time-limit`
   - `--boogie`
   - `--boogie-filter`
   - `--solver-path`


#### 13.5.1.4. `dafny translate <language>` {#sec-dafny-translate}

The `dafny translate` command translates Dafny source code to source code for another target programming language.
The command always performs the actions of `dafny resolve` and, unless the `--no-verify` option is specified, does the actions of `dafny verify`.
The language is designated by a subcommand argument, rather than an option, and is required.
The current set of supported target languages is 
- cs (C#)
- java (Java)
- js (JavaScript)
- py (Python)
- go (Go)
- cpp (C++ -- but only limited support)

In addition to generating the target source code, `dafny` may generate build artifacts to assist in compiling the generated code.
The specific files generated depend on the target programming language.
More detail is given in [the section on compilation](#sec-compilation).

The `dafny` tool intends that the compiled program in the target language be a semantically faithful rendering of the 
(verified) Dafny program. However, resource and language limitations make this not always possible. 
For example, though Dafny can express and reason about arrays of unbounded size, 
not all target programming languages can represent arrays larger than the maximum signed 32-bit integer.

Various options control the translation process, in addition to all those described for [`dafny resolve`](#sec-dafny-resolve) and [`dafny verify`](#sec-dafny-verify).

- General options:
   - `--no-verify` --- turns off all attempts to verify the program
   - `--verbose` --- print information about generated files

- The translation results
   - `--output` (or `-o`) --- location of the generated file(s) (this specifies a file path and name; a folder location for artifacts is derived from this name)
   - `--include-runtime` --- include the Dafny runtime for the target language in the generated artifacts
   - `--optimize-erasable-datatype-wrapper`
   - `--enforce-determinism`
   - `--test-assumptions` --- (experimental) inserts runtime checks for unverified assumptions when they are compilable

#### 13.5.1.5. `dafny build` {#sec-dafny-build}

The `dafny build` command runs `dafny translate` and then compiles the result into an executable artifact for the target platform,
such as a `.exe` or `.dll` or executable `.jar`, or just the source code for an interpreted language.
If the Dafny program does not have a Main entry point, then the build command creates a library, such as a `.dll` or `.jar`.
As with `dafny translate`, all the previous phases are also executed, including verification (unless `--no-verify` is a command-line option).
By default, the generated file is in the same directory and has the same name with a different extension as the first
.dfy file on the command line. This location and name can be set by the `--output` option.

The location of the `Main` entry point is described [here](#sec-user-guide-main}.

There are no additional options for `dafny build` beyond those for `dafny translate` and the previous compiler phases.

Note that `dafny build` may do optimizations that `dafny run` does not.

Details for specific target platforms are described [in Section 25.7](#sec-compilation).

#### 13.5.1.6. `dafny run` {#sec-dafny-run}

The `dafny run` command compiles the Dafny program and then runs the resulting executable.
Note that `dafny run` is engineered to quickly compile and launch the program; 
`dafny build` may take more time to do optimizations of the build artifacts.

The form of the `dafny run` command-line is slightly different than for other commands.
- It permits just one `.dfy` file, which must be the file containing the `Main` entry point;
the location of the `Main` entry point is described [here](#sec-user-guide-main}.
- Other files are included in the program either by `include` directives within that one file or by 
the `--input` option on the command-line. 
- Anything that is not an option and is not that one dfy file
is an argument to the program being run (and not to dafny itself).
- If the `--` option is used, then anything after that option is a command-line argument to the program being run.

If more complex build configurations are required, then use `dafny build` and then execute the compiled program, as two separate steps. 
`dafny run` is primarily intended as a convenient way to run relatively simple Dafny programs.

Here are some examples:
  - `dafny run A.dfy` -- builds and runs the Main program in `A.dfy` with no command-line arguments
  - `dafny run A.dfy --no-verify` -- builds the Main program in `A.dfy` using the `--no-verify` option, and then runs the program with no command-line arguments
  - `dafny run A.dfy -- --no-verify` -- builds the Main program in `A.dfy` (_not_ using the `--no-verify` option), and then runs the program with one command-line argument, namely `--no-verify`
  - `dafny run A.dfy 1 2 3 B.dfy` -- builds the Main program in `A.dfy` and
then runs it with the four command-line arguments `1 2 3 B.dfy`
  - `dafny run A.dfy 1 2 3 --input B.dfy` -- builds the Main program in `A.dfy` and `B.dfy`, and
then runs it with the three command-line arguments `1 2 3`
  - `dafny run A.dfy 1 2 -- 3 -quiet` -- builds the Main program in `A.dfy` and then runs it with the four command-line arguments `1 2 3 -quiet`


**Note:** `dafny run` will typically produce the same results as the executables produced by `dafny build`.  The only expected differences are these:
- performance --- `dafny run` may not optimize as much as `dafny build`
- target-language-specific configuration issues ---  e.g. encoding issues: `dafny run` sets language-specific flags to request UTF-8 output for the [`print`](#print-encoding) statement in all languages, whereas `dafny build` leaves language-specific runtime configuration to the user.

#### 13.5.1.7. `dafny server` {#sec-dafny-server}

The `dafny server` command starts the Dafny Language Server, which is an [LSP-compliant](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) implementation of Dafny.
The [Dafny VSCode extension]() uses this LSP implementation, which in turn uses the same core Dafny implementation as the command-line tool.

The Dafny Language Server is described in more detail [here](#sec-dafny-language-server-vscode).

#### 13.5.1.8. `dafny audit` {#sec-dafny-audit}

The `dafny audit` command reports issues in the Dafny code that might limit the soundness claims of verification.

_This command is under development._

The command executes the `dafny resolve` phase (accepting its options) and has the following additional options:

- `--report-file:<report-file>` --- spcifies the path where the audit
   report file will be stored. Without this option, the report
    will be issued as standard warnings, written to standard-out.
- `--report-format:<format>` --- specifies the file format to use for
   the audit report. Supported options include: 
   - 'txt, 'text': plain text in the format of warnings
   - 'html': standalone HTML ('html')
   - 'md', 'markdown', 'md-table', 'markdown-table': a Markdown table
   - 'md-ietf', 'markdown-ietf': an IETF-language document in Markdown format
   - The default is to infer the format from the filename extension
- `--compare-report` --- compare the report that would have
   been generated with the existing file given by --report-file, and fail if
   they differ.

The command emits exit codes of
- 1 for command-line errors
- 2 for parsing, type-checking or serious errors in running the auditor (e.g. failure to write a report or when report comparison fails)
- 0 for normal operation, including operation that identifies audit findings

It also takes the `--verbose` option, which then gives information about the files being formatted.

The `dafny audit` command currently reports the following:

* Any declaration marked with the `{:axiom}` attribute.
This is typically used to mark that a lemma with no body (and is therefore assumed to always be true) is intended as an axiom.
The key purpose of the `audit` command is to ensure that all assumptions are intentional and acknowledged.
To improve assurance, however, try to provide a proof.

* Any declaration marked with the `{:verify false}` attribute, which tells the verifier to skip verifying this declaration.
Removing the attribute and providing a proof will improve assurance.

* Any declaration marked with the `{:extern}` attribute that has at least one `requires` or `ensures` clause.
If code implemented externally, and called from Dafny, has an `ensures` clause, Dafny assumes that it satisfies that clause.
Since Dafny cannot prove properties about code written in other languages,
adding tests to provide evidence that any `ensures` clauses do hold can improve assurance.
The same considerations apply to `requires` clauses on Dafny code intended to be called from external code.

* Any declaration marked with the `{:concurrent}` attribute.
This is intended to indicate that the code is safe for use in a concurrent setting, but Dafny currently cannot prove that form of safety.
The [addition of `reads` clauses to methods](https://github.com/dafny-lang/rfcs/pull/6) will be a step toward being able to prove safety in this case,
but until it exists, careful inspection and testing are appropriate.

* Any definition with an `assume` statement in its body.
To improve assurance, attempt to convert it to an `assert` statement and prove that it holds.
Such a definition will not be compilable unless the statement is also marked with `{:axiom}`.
Alternatively, converting it to an `expect` statement will cause it to be checked at runtime.

* Any method marked with `decreases *`.
Such a method may not terminate.
Although this cannot cause an unsound proof, in the logic of Dafny,
it's generally important that any non-termination be intentional.

* Any `forall` statement without a body.
This is equivalent to an assumption of its conclusion.
To improve assurance, provide a body that proves the conclusion.

* Any loop without a body.
This is equivalent to an assumption of any loop invariants in the code after the loop.
To improve assurance, provide a body that establishes any stated invariants.

* Any declaration with no body and at least one `ensures` clause.
Any code that calls this declaration will assume that all `ensures` clauses are true after it returns.
To improve assurance, provide a body that proves that any `ensures` clauses hold.

#### 13.5.1.9. `dafny format` {#sec-dafny-format}

Dafny supports a formatter, which for now only changes the indentation of lines in a Dafny file, so that it conforms
to the idiomatic Dafny code formatting style.
For the formatter to work, the file should be parsed correctly by Dafny.

There are four ways to use the formatter:

* `dafny format <one or more .dfy files or folders>` formats the given Dafny files and the Dafny files in the folders, recursively, altering the files in place. For example, `dafny format .` formats all the Dafny files recursively in the current folder.
* `dafny format --print <files and/or folders>` formats each file but instead of altering the files, output the formatted content to stdout
* `dafny format --check <files and/or folders>` does not alter files. It will print a message concerning which files need formatting and return a non-zero exit code if any files would be changed by formatting.

You can also use `--stdin` instead of providing a file, to format a full Dafny file from the standard input.
Input files can be named along with `--stdin`, in which case both the files and the content of the stdin are formatted.

Each version of `dafny format` returns a non-zero return code if there are any command-line or parsing
errors or if --check is stipulated and at least one file is not the same as its formatted version.  
`dafny format` does not necessarily report name or type resolution errors and does not attempt verification.

#### 13.5.1.10. `dafny test` {#sec-dafny-test}
 
This command (verifies and compiles the program and) runs every method in the program that is annotated with the [`{:test}` attribute](#sec-test-attribute).
Verification can be disabled using the `--no-verify` option. `dafny test` also accepts all other options of the `dafny build` command. 
In particular, it accepts the `--target` option that specifies the programming language used in the build and execution phases.

`dafny test` also accepts these options:

- `-spill-translation` - (default disabled) when enabled the compilation artifacts are retained
- `--output` - gives the folder and filename root for compilation artifacts
- `--methods-to-test` - the value is a (.NET) regular expression that is matched against the fully
  qualified name of the method; only those methods that match are tested

The order in which the tests are run is not specified.

For example, this code (as the file `t.dfy`)
<!-- %no-check -->
```dafny
method {:test} m() {
  mm();
  print "Hi!\n";
}

method mm() {
  print "mm\n";
}

module M {
  method {:test} q() {
    print 42, "\n";
  }
}

class A {
  static method {:test} t() { print "T\n"; }
}
```
and this command-line
```bash
dafny test --no-verify t.dfy
```
produce this output text:
```text
M.q: 42
PASSED
A.t: T
PASSED
m: mm
Hi!

#### 13.5.1.11. `dafny doc` [Experimental] {#sec-dafny-doc}

The `dafny doc` command generates HTML documentation pages describing the contents of each
module in a set of files, using the documentation comments in the source files.
This command is experimental; user feedback and contributor PRs on the layout of information and the navigation are welcome.

* The format of the documentation comments is described [here](#sec-documentation-comments).
* The `dafny doc` command accepts either files or folders as command-line arguments. A folder
represents all the `.dfy` files contained recursively in that folder. A file that is a `.toml`
[project file](#sec-project-files) represents all the files and options listed in the project file.
* The command first parses and resolves the given files; it only proceeds to produce documentation
if type resolution is successful (on all files). All the command-line options relevant to 
`dafny resolve` are available for `dafny doc`.
* The value of the `--output` option is a folder in which all the generated files will be placed.
The default location is `./docs`. The folder is created if it does not already exist.
Any existing content of the folder is overwritten.
* If `--verbose` is enabled, a list of the generated files is emitted to stdout.
* The output files contain information stating the source .dfy file in which the module is
declared. The `--file-name` option controls the form of the filename in that information:
   * --file-name:none -- no source file information is emitted
   * --file-name:name -- (default) just the file name is emitted (e.g., `Test.dfy`)
   * --file-name:absolute -- an absolute full path is emitted
   * --file-name:relative=<prefix> -- a file name relative to the given prefix is emitted
* If `--modify-time` is enabled, then the generated files contain information stating the
last modified time of the source of the module being documented.
* The `--program-name` option states text that will be included in the heading of the TOC and index pages

The output files are HTML files, all contained in the given folder, one per module plus an 
`index.html` file giving an overall table of contents and a `nameindex.html` file containing
an alphabetical by name list of all the declarations in all the modules.
The documentation for the root module is in `_.html`.

#### 13.5.1.12. `dafny generate-tests` {#sec-dafny-generate-tests}

This _experimental_ command generates unit test code (as Dafny source code) that provides
complete coverage of a method indicated with the --target-method option.

This command enforces determinism by default and disables the functionality provided by the --snow-snippets option.

_This command is under development and not yet fully functional._

#### 13.5.1.13. `dafny find-dead-code` {#sec-dafny-find-dead-code}

This _experimental_ command finds dead code in a program, that is, code branches within a method that are not reachable by any inputs that satisfy 
the method's preconditions.

_This command is under development and not yet functional._

#### 13.5.1.14. `dafny measure-complexity` {#sec-dafny-measure-complexity}

This _experimental_ command reports complexity metrics of a program.

_This command is under development and not yet functional._

#### 13.5.1.15. Plugins

This execution mode is not a command, per se, but rather a command-line option that enables executing plugins to the dafny tool.
Plugins may be either standalone tools or be additions to existing commands.

The form of the command-line is `dafny --plugin:<path-to-one-assembly[,argument]*>` or `dafny <command> --plugin:<path-to-one-assembly[,argument]*>`
where the argument to `--plugin` gives the path to the compiled assembly of the plugin and the arguments to be provided to the plugin.

More on writing and building plugins can be found [in this section](#sec-plugins).

#### 13.5.1.16. Legacy operation

Prior to implementing the command-based CLI, the `dafny` command-line simply took files and options and the arguments to options.
That legacy mode of operation is still supported, though discouraged. The command `dafny -?` produces the list of legacy options.
In particular, the common commands like `dafny verify` and `dafny build` are accomplished with combinations of 
options like `-compile`, `-compileTarget` and `-spillTargetCode`.
 
Users are encouraged to migrate to the command-based style of command-lines and the double-hyphen options.

### 13.5.2. In-tool help

As is typical for command-line tools, `dafny` provides in-tool help through the `-h` and `--help` options:
- `dafny -h`, `dafny --help` list the commands available in the `dafny` tool
- `dafny -?` lists all the (legacy) options implemented in `dafny`
- `dafny <command> -h`, `dafny <command> --help`, `dafny <command> -?` list the options available for that command

### 13.5.3. dafny exit codes {#sec-exit-codes}

The basic resolve, verify, translate, build, run and commands of dafny terminate with these exit codes.

* 0 -- success
* 1 -- invalid command-line arguments
* 2 -- syntax, parse, or name or type resolution errors
* 3 -- compilation errors
* 4 -- verification errors

Errors in earlier phases of processing typically hide later errors.
For example, if a program has parsing errors, verification or compilation will
not be attempted.

Other dafny commands may have their own conventions for exit codes. 
However in all cases, an exit code of 0 indicates successful completion of the command's
task and small positive integer values indicate errors of some sort.

### 13.5.4. dafny output

Most output from `dafny` is directed to the standard output of the shell invoking the tool, though some goes to standard error.
- Command-line errors: these are produced by the dotnet CommandLineOptions package are directed to **standard-error**
- Other errors: parsing, typechecking, verification and compilation errors are directed to **standard-out**
- Non-error progress information also is output to **standard-out**
- Dafny `print` statements, when executed, send output to **standard-out**
- Dafny `expect` statements (when they fail) send a message to **standard-out**.
- Dafny I/O libraries send output explicitly to either **standard-out or standard-error**

### 13.5.5. Project files {#sec-project-files}

Commands on the Dafny CLI that can be passed a Dafny file can also be passed a Dafny project file. Such a project file may define which Dafny files the project contains and which Dafny options it uses. The project file must be a [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) file named `dfyconfig.toml` for it to work on both the CLI and in the Dafny IDE, although the CLI will accept any `.toml` file. 
Here's an example of a Dafny project file:

```toml
includes = ["src/**/*.dfy"]
excludes = ["**/ignore.dfy"]

[options]
enforce-determinism = true
warn-shadowing = true
```

- At most one `.toml` file may be named on the command-line; when using the command-line no `.toml` file is used by default.
- In the `includes` and `excludes` lists, the file paths may have wildcards, including `**` to mean any number of directory levels; filepaths are relative to the location of the `.toml` file in which they are named.
- Dafny will process the union of (a) the files on the command-line and (b) the files designated in the `.toml` file, which are those specified by the `includes`, omitting those specified by the `excludes`.
The `excludes` does not remove any files that are listed explicitly on the command-line.
- Under the section `[options]`, any options from the Dafny CLI can be specified using the option's name without the `--` prefix. 
- When executing a `dafny` command using a project file, any options specified in the file that can be applied to the command, will be. Options that can't be applied are ignored; options that are invalid for any dafny command trigger warnings.
- Options specified on the command-line take precedence over any specified in the project file, no matter the order of items on the command-line.
- When using a Dafny IDE based on the `dafny server` command, the IDE will search for project files by traversing up the file tree looking for the closest `dfyconfig.toml` file to the dfy being parsed that it can find. Options from the project file will override options passed to `dafny server`.

It's not possible to use Dafny project files in combination with the legacy CLI UI.

## 13.6. Verification {#sec-verification}

In this section, we suggest a methodology to figure out [why a single assertion might not hold](#sec-verification-debugging), we propose techniques to deal with [assertions that slow a proof down](#sec-verification-debugging-slow), we explain how to [verify assertions in parallel or in a focused way](#sec-assertion-batches), and we also give some more examples of [useful options and attributes to control verification](#sec-command-line-options-and-attributes-for-verification).

### 13.6.1. Verification debugging when verification fails {#sec-verification-debugging}

Let's assume one assertion is failing ("assertion might not hold" or "postcondition might not hold"). What should you do next?

The following section is textual description of the animation below, which illustrates the principle of debugging an assertion by computing the weakest precondition:  
![weakestpreconditionDemo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3601079/157976402-83fe4d37-8042-40fc-940f-bcfc235c7d2b.gif)

#### 13.6.1.1. Failing postconditions {#sec-failing-postconditions}
Let's look at an example of a failing postcondition.
<!-- %check-verify UserGuide.1.expect -->
```dafny
method FailingPostcondition(b: bool) returns (i: int)
  ensures 2 <= i
{
  var j := if !b then 3 else 1;
  if b {
    return j;
  }//^^^^^^^ a postcondition might not hold on this return path.
  i := 2;
}
```
One first thing you can do is replace the statement `return j;` by two statements `i := j; return;` to better understand what is wrong:
<!-- %check-verify UserGuide.2.expect -->
```dafny
method FailingPostcondition(b: bool) returns (i: int)
  ensures 2 <= i
{
  var j := if !b then 3 else 1;
  if b {
    i := j;
    return;
  }//^^^^^^^ a postcondition might not hold on this return path.
  i := 2;
}
```
Now, you can assert the postcondition just before the return:
<!-- %check-verify UserGuide.3.expect -->
```dafny
method FailingPostcondition(b: bool) returns (i: int)
  ensures 2 <= i
{
  var j := if !b then 3 else 1;
  if b {
    i := j;
    assert 2 <= i; // This assertion might not hold
    return;
  }
  i := 2;
}
```
That's it! Now the postcondition is not failing anymore, but the `assert` contains the error!
you can now move to the next section to find out how to debug this `assert`.

#### 13.6.1.2. Failing asserts {#sec-failing-asserts}
In the [previous section](#sec-failing-postconditions), we arrived at the point where we have a failing assertion:
<!-- %check-verify UserGuide.4.expect -->
```dafny
method FailingPostcondition(b: bool) returns (i: int)
  ensures 2 <= i
{
  var j := if !b then 3 else 1;
  if b {
    i := j;
    assert 2 <= i; // This assertion might not hold
    return;
  }
  i := 2;
}
```
To debug why this assert might not hold, we need to _move this assert up_, which is similar to [_computing the weakest precondition_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_transformer_semantics#Weakest_preconditions).
For example, if we have `x := Y; assert F;` and the `assert F;` might not hold, the weakest precondition for it to hold before `x := Y;` can be written as the assertion `assert F[x:= Y];`, where we replace every occurence of `x` in `F` into `Y`.
Let's do it in our example:
<!-- %check-verify UserGuide.5.expect -->
```dafny
method FailingPostcondition(b: bool) returns (i: int)
  ensures 2 <= i
{
  var j := if !b then 3 else 1;
  if b {
    assert 2 <= j; // This assertion might not hold
    i := j;
    assert 2 <= i;
    return;
  }
  i := 2;
}
```
Yay! The assertion `assert 2 <= i;` is not proven wrong, which means that if we manage to prove `assert 2 <= j;`, it will work.
Now, this assert should hold only if we are in this branch, so to _move the assert up_, we need to guard it.
Just before the `if`, we can add the weakest precondition `assert b ==> (2 <= j)`:
<!-- %check-verify UserGuide.6.expect -->
```dafny
method FailingPostcondition(b: bool) returns (i: int)
  ensures 2 <= i
{
  var j := if !b then 3 else 1;
  assert b  ==>  2 <= j;  // This assertion might not hold
  if b {
    assert 2 <= j;
    i := j;
    assert 2 <= i;
    return;
  }
  i := 2;
}
```
Again, now the error is only on the topmost assert, which means that we are making progress.
Now, either the error is obvious, or we can one more time replace `j` by its value and create the assert `assert b ==> ((if !b then 3 else 1) >= 2);`
<!-- %check-verify UserGuide.7.expect -->
```dafny
method FailingPostcondition(b: bool) returns (i: int)
  ensures 2 <= i
{
  assert b  ==>  2 <= (if !b then 3 else 1);  // This assertion might not hold
  var j := if !b then 3 else 1;
  assert b  ==>  2 <= j;
  if b {
    assert 2 <= j;
    i := j;
    assert 2 <= i;
    return;
  }
  i := 2;
}
```
At this point, this is pure logic. We can simplify the assumption:
<!-- %no-check -->
```dafny
b ==>  2 <= (if !b then 3 else 1)
!b ||  (if !b then 2 <= 3 else 2 <= 1)
!b ||  (if !b then true else false)
!b || !b;
!b;
```
Now we can understand what went wrong: When b is true, all of these formulas above are false, this is why the `dafny` verifier was not able to prove them.
In the next section, we will explain how to "move asserts up" in certain useful patterns.

#### 13.6.1.3. Failing asserts cases {#sec-failing-asserts-special-cases}

This list is not exhaustive but can definitely be useful to provide the next step to figure out why Dafny could not prove an assertion.

### 13.6.2. Verification debugging when verification is slow {#sec-verification-debugging-slow}

In this section, we describe techniques to apply in the case when verification is slower than expected, does not terminate, or times out.

Additional detail is available in the [verification optimization guide](../VerificationOptimization/VerificationOptimization).

#### 13.6.2.1. `assume false;` {#sec-assume-false}

Assuming `false` is an empirical way to short-circuit the verifier and usually stop verification at a given point,[^explainer-assume-false] and since the final compilation steps do not accept this command, it is safe to use it during development.
Another similar command, `assert false;`, would also short-circuit the verifier, but it would still make the verifier try to prove `false`, which can also lead to timeouts.

[^explainer-assume-false]: `assume false` tells the `dafny` verifier "Assume everything is true from this point of the program". The reason is that, 'false' proves anything. For example, `false ==> A` is always true because it is equivalent to `!false || A`, which reduces to `true || A`, which reduces to `true`.

Thus, let us say a program of this shape takes forever to verify.

<!-- %no-check -->
```dafny
method NotTerminating(b: bool) {
   assert X;
   if b {
     assert Y;
   } else {
     assert Z;
     assert P;
   }
}
```

What we can first do is add an `assume false` at the beginning of the method:

<!-- %no-check -->
```dafny
method NotTerminating() {
   assume false; // Will never compile, but everything verifies instantly
   assert X;
   if b {
     assert Y;
   } else {
     assert Z;
     assert P;
   }
   assert W;
}
```

This verifies instantly. This gives use a strategy to bisect, or do binary search to find the assertion that slows everything down.
Now, we move the `assume false;` below the next assertion:

<!-- %no-check -->
```dafny
method NotTerminating() {
   assert X;
   assume false;
   if b {
     assert Y;
   } else {
     assert Z;
     assert P;
   }
   assert W;
}
```

If verification is slow again, we can use [techniques seen before](#sec-verification-debugging) to decompose the assertion and find which component is slow to prove.

If verification is fast, that's the sign that `X` is probably not the problem,. We now move the `assume false;` after the if/then block:

<!-- %no-check -->
```dafny
method NotTerminating() {
   assert X;
   if b {
     assert Y;
   } else {
     assert Z;
     assert P;
   }
   assume false;
   assert W;
}
```

Now, if verification is fast, we know that `assert W;` is the problem. If it is slow, we know that one of the two branches of the `if` is the problem.
The next step is to put an `assume false;` at the end of the `then` branch, and an `assume false` at the beginning of the else branch:

<!-- %no-check -->
```dafny
method NotTerminating() {
   assert X;
   if b {
     assert Y;
     assume false;
   } else {
     assume false;
     assert Z;
     assert P;
   }
   assert W;
}
```

Now, if verification is slow, it means that `assert Y;` is the problem.
If verification is fast, it means that the problem lies in the `else` branch.
One trick to ensure we measure the verification time of the `else` branch and not the then branch is to move the first `assume false;` to the top of the then branch, along with a comment indicating that we are short-circuiting it for now.
Then, we can move the second `assume false;` down and identify which of the two assertions makes the verifier slow.


<!-- %no-check -->
```dafny
method NotTerminating() {
   assert X;
   if b {
     assume false; // Short-circuit because this branch is verified anyway
     assert Y;
   } else {
     assert Z;
     assume false;
     assert P;
   }
   assert W;
}
```

If verification is fast, which of the two assertions `assert Z;` or `assert P;` causes the slowdown?[^answer-slowdown]

[^answer-slowdown]: `assert P;`.

We now hope you know enough of `assume false;` to locate assertions that make verification slow.
Next, we will describe some other strategies at the assertion level to figure out what happens and perhaps fix it.

#### 13.6.2.2. `assert ... by {}` {#sec-verification-debugging-assert-by}

If an assertion `assert X;` is slow, it is possible that calling a lemma or invoking other assertions can help to prove it: The postcondition of this lemma, or the added assertions, could help the `dafny` verifier figure out faster how to prove the result.

<!-- %no-check -->
```dafny
  assert SOMETHING_HELPING_TO_PROVE_LEMMA_PRECONDITION;
  LEMMA();
  assert X;
...
lemma () 
  requires LEMMA_PRECONDITION
  ensures X { ... }
```

However, this approach has the problem that it exposes the asserted expressions and lemma postconditions not only for the assertion we want to prove faster,
but also for every assertion that appears afterwards. This can result in slowdowns[^verifier-lost].
A good practice consists of wrapping the intermediate verification steps in an `assert ... by {}`, like this:


<!-- %no-check -->
```dafny
  assert X by {
    assert SOMETHING_HELPING_TO_PROVE_LEMMA_PRECONDITION;
    LEMMA();
  }
```

Now, only `X` is available for the `dafny` verifier to prove the rest of the method.

[^verifier-lost]: By default, the expression of an assertion or a precondition is added to the knowledge base of the `dafny` verifier for further assertions or postconditions. However, this is not always desirable, because if the verifier has too much knowledge, it might get lost trying to prove something in the wrong direction.

#### 13.6.2.3. Labeling and revealing assertions {#sec-labeling-revealing-assertions}

Another way to prevent assertions or preconditions from cluttering the verifier[^verifier-lost] is to label and reveal them.
Labeling an assertion has the effect of "hiding" its result, until there is a "reveal" calling that label.

The example of the [previous section](#sec-verification-debugging-assert-by) could be written like this.

<!-- %no-check -->
```dafny
  assert p: SOMETHING_HELPING_TO_PROVE_LEMMA_PRECONDITION;
  // p is not available here.
  assert X by {
    reveal p;
    LEMMA();
  }
```

Similarly, if a precondition is only needed to prove a specific result in a method, one can label and reveal the precondition, like this:

<!-- %check-verify -->
```dafny
method Slow(i: int, j: int)
  requires greater: i > j {
  
  assert i >= j by {
    reveal greater;
  }
}
```

Labelled assert statements are available both in expressions and statements.
Assertion labels are not accessible outside of the block which the assert statement is in.
If you need to access an assertion label outside of the enclosing expression or statement,
you need to lift the labelled statement at the right place manually, e.g. rewrite

<!-- %no-check -->
```dafny
ghost predicate P(i: int)

method TestMethod(x: bool)
  requires r: x <==> P(1)
{
  if x {
    assert a: P(1) by { reveal r; }
  }
  assert x ==> P(1) by { reveal a; } // Error, a is not accessible
}
```
to

<!-- %check-verify -->
```dafny
ghost predicate P(i: int)

method TestMethod(x: bool)
  requires r: x <==> P(1)
{
  assert a: x ==> P(1) by {
    if x {
      assert P(1) by { reveal r; } // Proved without revealing the precondition
    }
  }
  assert x ==> P(1) by { reveal a; } // Now a is accessible
}
```

To lift assertions, please refer to the techniques described in [Verification Debugging](#sec-verification-debugging).

#### 13.6.2.4. Non-opaque `function method` {#sec-non-opaque-function-method}

Functions are normally used for specifications, but their functional syntax is sometimes also desirable to write application code.
However, doing so naively results in the body of a `function method Fun()` be available for every caller, which can cause the verifier to time out or get extremely slow[^verifier-lost].
A solution for that is to add the attribute [`{:opaque}`](#sec-opaque) right between `function method` and `Fun()`, and use [`reveal Fun();`](#sec-reveal-statement) in the calling functions or methods when needed.

#### 13.6.2.5. Conversion to and from bitvectors {#sec-conversion-to-and-from-bitvectors}

Bitvectors and natural integers are very similar, but they are not treated the same by the `dafny` verifier. As such, conversion from `bv8` to an `int` and vice-versa is not straightforward, and can result in slowdowns.

There are two solutions to this for now. First, one can define a [subset type](#sec-subset-types) instead of using the built-in type `bv8`:

<!-- %check-resolve -->
```dafny
type byte = x | 0 <= x < 256
```

One of the problems of this approach is that additions, substractions and multiplications do not enforce the result to be in the same bounds, so it would have to be checked, and possibly truncated with modulos. For example:

<!-- %check-resolve -->
```dafny
type byte = x | 0 <= x < 256
method m() {
  var a: byte := 250;
  var b: byte := 200;
  var c := b - a;               // inferred to be an 'int', its value will be 50.
  var d := a + b;               // inferred to be an 'int', its value will be 450.
  var e := (a + b) % 256;       // still inferred to be an 'int'...
  var f: byte := (a + b) % 256; // OK
}
```

A better solution consists of creating a [newtype](#sec-newtypes) that will have the ability to check bounds of arithmetic expressions, and can actually be compiled to bitvectors as well.

<!-- %check-verify UserGuide.8.expect -->
```dafny
newtype {:nativeType "short"} byte = x | 0 <= x < 256
method m() {
  var a: byte := 250;
  var b: byte := 200;
  var c := b - a; // OK, inferred to be a byte
  var d := a + b; // Error: cannot prove that the result of a + b is of type `byte`.
  var f := ((a as int + b as int) % 256) as byte; // OK
}
```

One might consider refactoring this code into separate functions if used over and over.

#### 13.6.2.6. Nested loops {#sec-nested-loops}

In the case of nested loops, the verifier might timeout sometimes because of inadequate or too much available information[^verifier-lost].
One way to mitigate this problem, when it happens, is to isolate the inner loop by refactoring it into a separate method, with suitable pre and postconditions that will usually assume and prove the invariant again.
For example,

<!-- %no-check -->
```dafny
while X
   invariant Y
 {
   while X'
     invariant Y'
   {
 
   }
 }
```

could be refactored as this:

<!-- %no-check -->
```dafny
`while X
   invariant Y
 {
   innerLoop();
 }
...
method innerLoop()
  require Y'
  ensures Y'
```

In the next section, when everything can be proven in a timely manner, we explain another strategy to decrease proof time by parallelizing it if needed, and making the verifier focus on certain parts.

### 13.6.3. Assertion batches {#sec-assertion-batches}

To understand how to control verification,
it is first useful to understand how `dafny` verifies functions and methods.

For every method (or function, constructor, etc.), `dafny` extracts _assertions_. Here is a non-exhaustive list of such extracted assertions:

**Integer assertions:**

* Every [division](#sec-numeric-types) yields an _assertion_ that the divisor is never zero.
* Every [bounded number operation](#sec-numeric-types) yields an _assertion_ that the result will be within the same bounds (no overflow, no underflows).
* Every [conversion](#sec-as-is-expression) yields an _assertion_ that conversion is compatible.
* Every [bitvector shift](#sec-bit-vector-types) yields an _assertion_ that the shift amount is never negative, and that the shift amount is within the width of the value.

**Object assertions:**

* Every [object property access](#sec-class-types) yields an _assertion_ that the object is not null.
* Every assignment `o.f := E;` yields an _assertion_ that `o` is among the set of objects of the `modifies` clause of the enclosing [loop](#sec-loop-framing) or [method](#sec-modifies-clause).
* Every read `o.f` yields an _assertion_ that `o` is among the set of objects of the [`reads`](#sec-reads-clause) clause of the enclosing function or predicate; or the [`modifies`](#sec-modifies-clause) clause of the enclosing method.
* Every [array access](#sec-array-type) `a[x]` yields the assertion that `0 <= x < a.Length`.
* Every [sequence access](#sec-sequences) `a[x]` yields an _assertion_, that `0 <= x < |a|`, because sequences are never null.
* Every [datatype update expression](#sec-datatype-update-suffix) and [datatype destruction](#sec-algebraic-datatype) yields an _assertion_ that the object has the given property.
* Every method overriding a [`trait`](#sec-trait-types) yields an _assertion_ that any postcondition it provides implies the postcondition of its parent trait, and an _assertion_ that any precondition it provides is implied by the precondition of its parent trait.

**Other implicit assertions:**

* Every value whose type is assigned to a [subset type](#sec-subset-types) yields an _assertion_ that it satisfies the subset type constraint.
* Every non-empty [subset type](#sec-subset-types) yields an _assertion_ that its witness satisfies the constraint.
* Every [Assign-such-that operator](#sec-update-and-call-statement) `x :| P(x)` yields an _assertion_ that `exists x :: P(x)`.
* Every recursive function yields an _assertion_ that [it terminates](#sec-loop-termination).
* Every [match expression](#sec-match-expression) or [alternative if statement](#sec-if-statement) yields an _assertion_ that all cases are covered.

**Explicit assertions:**

* Any explicit [`assert`](#sec-assert-statement) statement is _an assertion_[^precision-requires-clause].
* A consecutive pair of lines in a [`calc`](#sec-calc-statement) statement forms _an assertion_ that the expressions are related according to the common operator.
* Every call to a function or method with a [`requires`](#sec-requires-clause) clause yields _one assertion per requires clause_[^precision-requires-clause]
  (special cases such as sequence indexing come with a special `requires` clause that the index is within bounds).
* Every [`ensures`](#sec-ensures-clause) clause yields an _assertion_ at the end of the method and on every return, and on [`forall`](#sec-forall-statement) statements.
* Every [`invariant`](#sec-invariant-clause) clause yields an _assertion_ that it holds before the loop and an _assertion_ that it holds at the end of the loop.
* Every [`decreases`](#sec-decreases-clause) clause yields an _assertion_ at either a call site or at the end of a while loop.
* Every [`yield ensures`](#sec-iterator-specification) clause on an [iterator](#sec-iterator-types) yields _assertions_ that the clause holds at every yielding point.
* Every [`yield requires`](#sec-iterator-specification) clause on an [iterator](#sec-iterator-types) yields _assertions_ that the clause holds at every point when the iterator is called.


[^precision-requires-clause]: `dafny` actually breaks things down further. For example, a precondition `requires A && B` or an assert statement `assert A && B;` turns into two assertions, more or less like `requires A requires B` and `assert A; assert B;`.

It is useful to mentally visualize all these assertions as a list that roughly follows the order in the code,
except for `ensures` or `decreases` that generate assertions that seem earlier in the code but, for verification purposes, would be placed later.
In this list, each assertion depends on other assertions, statements and expressions that appear earlier in the control flow[^complexity-path-encoding].

[^complexity-path-encoding]: All the complexities of the execution paths (if-then-else, loops, goto, break....) are, down the road and for verification purposes, cleverly encoded with variables recording the paths and guarding assumptions made on each path. In practice, a second clever encoding of variables enables grouping many assertions together, and recovers which assertion is failing based on the value of variables that the SMT solver returns.

The fundamental unit of verification in `dafny` is an _assertion batch_, which consists of one or more assertions from this "list", along with all the remaining assertions turned into assumptions. To reduce overhead, by default `dafny` collects all the assertions in the body of a given method into a single assertion batch that it sends to the verifier, which tries to prove it correct.

* If the verifier says it is correct,[^smt-encoding] it means that all the assertions hold.
* If the verifier returns a counterexample, this counterexample is used to determine both the failing assertion and the failing path.
  In order to retrieve additional failing assertions, `dafny` will again query the verifier after turning previously failed assertions into assumptions.[^example-assertion-turned-into-assumption] [^caveat-about-assertion-and-assumption]
* If the verifier returns `unknown` or times out, or even preemptively for difficult assertions or to reduce the chance that the verifier will ‘be confused’ by the many assertions in a large batch, `dafny` may partition the assertions into smaller batches[^smaller-batches]. An extreme case is the use of the `/vcsSplitOnEveryAssert` command-line option or the [`{:vcs_split_on_every_assert}` attribute](#sec-vcs_split_on_every_assert), which causes `dafny` to make one batch for each assertion.

[^smt-encoding]: The formula sent to the underlying SMT solver is the negation of the formula that the verifier wants to prove - also called a VC or verification condition. Hence, if the SMT solver returns "unsat", it means that the SMT formula is always false, meaning the verifier's formula is always true. On the other side, if the SMT solver returns "sat", it means that the SMT formula can be made true with a special variable assignment, which means that the verifier's formula is false under that same variable assignment, meaning it's a counter-example for the verifier. In practice and because of quantifiers, the SMT solver will usually return "unknown" instead of "sat", but will still provide a variable assignment that it couldn't prove that it does not make the formula true. `dafny` reports it as a "counter-example" but it might not be a real counter-example, only provide hints about what `dafny` knows.

[^example-assertion-turned-into-assumption]: This [post](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/discussions/1898#discussioncomment-2344533) gives an overview of how assertions are turned into assumptions for verification purposes.

[^caveat-about-assertion-and-assumption]: Caveat about assertion and assumption: One big difference between an "assertion transformed in an assumption" and the original "assertion" is that the original "assertion" can unroll functions twice, whereas the "assumed assertion" can unroll them only once. Hence, `dafny` can still continue to analyze assertions after a failing assertion without automatically proving "false" (which would make all further assertions vacuous).

[^smaller-batches]: To create a smaller batch, `dafny` duplicates the assertion batch, and arbitrarily transforms the clones of an assertion into assumptions except in exactly one batch, so that each assertion is verified only in one batch. This results in "easier" formulas for the verifier because it has less to prove, but it takes more overhead because every verification instance have a common set of axioms and there is no knowledge sharing between instances because they run independently.

#### 13.6.3.1. Controlling assertion batches {#sec-assertion-batches-control}

Here is how you can control how `dafny` partitions assertions into batches.

* [`{:focus}`](#sec-focus) on an assert generates a separate assertion batch for the assertions of the enclosing block.
* [`{:split_here}`](#sec-split_here) on an assert generates a separate assertion batch for assertions after this point.
* [`{:vcs_split_on_every_assert}`](#sec-vcs_split_on_every_assert) on a function or a method generates one assertion batch per assertion

We discourage the use of the following _heuristics attributes_ to partition assertions into batches.
The effect of these attributes may vary, because they are low-level attributes and tune low-level heuristics, and will result in splits that could be manually controlled anyway.
* [`{:vcs_max_cost N}`](#sec-vcs_max_cost) on a function or method enables splitting the assertion batch until the "cost" of each batch is below N.
  Usually, you would set [`{:vcs_max_cost 0}`](#sec-vcs_max_cost) and [`{:vcs_max_splits N}`](#sec-vcs_max_splits) to ensure it generates N assertion batches.
* [`{:vcs_max_keep_going_splits N}`](#sec-vcs_max_keep_going_splits) where N > 1 on a method dynamically splits the initial assertion batch up to N components if the verifier is stuck the first time.

### 13.6.4. Command-line options and other attributes to control verification {#sec-command-line-options-and-attributes-for-verification}

There are many great options that control various aspects of verifying dafny programs. Here we mention only a few:

- Control of output: [`/dprint`](#sec-controlling-output), [`/rprint`](#sec-controlling-output), `/stats`, [`/compileVerbose`](#sec-controlling-compilation)
- Whether to print warnings: `/proverWarnings`
- Control of time: `/timeLimit`
- Control of resources: `/rLimit` and [`{:rlimit}`](#sec-rlimit)
- Control of the prover used: `/prover`
- Control of how many times to _unroll_ functions: [`{:fuel}`](#sec-fuel)

You can search for them in [this file](https://dafny-lang.github.io/dafny/DafnyRef/DafnyRef) as some of them are still documented in raw text format.

### 13.6.5. Debugging variable verification

When evolving a Dafny codebase, it can sometimes occur that a proof
obligation succeeds at first only for the prover to time out or report a
potential error after minor, valid changes. This is ultimately due to
decidability limitations in the form of automated reasoning that Dafny
uses. The Z3 SMT solver that Dafny depends on attempts to efficiently
search for proofs, but does so using both incomplete heuristics and a
degree of randomness, with the result that it can sometimes fail to find
a proof even when one exists (or continue searching forever).

Dafny provides some features to mitigate this issue, primarily focused
on early detection. The philosophy is that, if Dafny programmers are
alerted to proofs that show early signs of variability, before they are
obviously so, they can refactor the proofs to make them less variable
before further development becomes difficult.

The mechanism for early detection focuses on measuring the resources
used to complete a proof (either using duration or a more deterministic
"resource count" metric available from Z3). Dafny can re-run a given
proof attempt multiple times after automatically making minor changes to
the structure of the input or to the random choices made by the solver.
If the resources used during these attempts (or the ability to find a
proof at all) vary widely, we say that the verification of the relevant
properties is _highly variable_.

#### 13.6.5.1. Measuring proof variability

To measure the variability of your proofs, start by using the
`-randomSeedIterations:N` flag to instruct Dafny to attempt each proof
goal `N` times, using a different random seed each time. The random seed
used for each attempt is derived from the global random seed `S`
specified with `-randomSeed:S`, which defaults to `0` (which means use
an arbitrary -- e.g. clock-based -- seed).

For most use cases, it also makes sense to specify the
`-verificationLogger:csv` flag, to log verification cost statistics to a
CSV file. By default, the resulting CSV files will be created in the
`TestResults` folder of the current directory.

Once Dafny has completed, the
[`dafny-reportgenerator`](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny-reportgenerator/)
tool is a convenient way to process the output. It allows you to specify
several limits on statistics computed from the elapsed time or solver
resource use of each proof goal, returning an error code when it detects
violations of these limits. You can find documentation on the full set
of options for `dafny-reportgenerator` in its
[`README.md`](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny-reportgenerator/blob/main/README.md)
file.

In general, we recommend something like the following:

<!-- %no-check -->
```bash
dafny-reportgenerator --max-resource-cv-pct 10 TestResults/*.csv
```

This bounds the [coefficient of
variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation) of
the solver resource count at 10% (0.10). We recommend a limit of less
than 20%, perhaps even as low as 5%. However, when beginning to analyze
a new project, it may be necessary to set limits as high as a few
hundred percent and incrementally ratchet down the limit over time.

When first analyzing proof variability, you may also find that certain proof
goals succeed on some iterations and fail on others. If your aim is
first to ensure that variability doesn't worsen and then to start
improving it, integrating `dafny-reportgenerator` into CI and using the
`--allow-different-outcomes` flag may be appropriate. Then, once you've
improved variability sufficiently, you can likely remove that flag (and
likely have significantly lower limits on other variability metrics).

#### 13.6.5.2. Improving proof variability

Improving proof variability is typically closely related to improving
performance overall. As such, [techniques for debugging slow
verification](#sec-verification-debugging-slow) are typically useful for
debugging highly variable verification, as well. See also the
[verification optimization
guide](../VerificationOptimization/VerificationOptimization).

## 13.7. Compilation {#sec-compilation}

The `dafny` tool can compile a Dafny program to one of several target languages. Details and idiosyncrasies of each
of these are described in the following subsections. In general note the following:

- The compiled code originating from `dafny` can be combined with other source and binary code, but only the `dafny`-originated code is verified.
- Output file or folder names can be set using `--output`.
- Code generated by `dafny` requires a Dafny-specific runtime library.  By default the runtime is included in the generated code. However for `dafny translate` it is not
included by default and must be explicitly requested using `--include-runtime`.  All runtime libraries are part of the Binary (`./DafnyRuntime.*`) and Source (`./Source/DafnyRuntime/DafnyRuntime.*`) releases.
- Names in Dafny are written out as names in the target language. In some cases this can result in naming conflicts. Thus if a Dafny program is intended to be compiled to a target language X, you should avoid using Dafny identifiers that are not legal identifiers in X or that conflict with reserved words in X.

To be compilable to an executable program, a Dafny program must contain a `Main` entry point, as described [here](#sec-user-guide-main).


### 13.7.1. `extern` declarations {#sec-extern-decls}

A Dafny declaration can be marked with the [`{:extern}`](#sec-extern) attribute to
indicate that it refers to an external definition that is already
present in the language that the Dafny code will be compiled to (or will
be present by the time the final target-language program is compiled or
run).

Because the [`{:extern}`](#sec-extern) attribute controls interaction with code written
in one of many languages, it has some language-specific behavior,
documented in the following sections. However, some aspects are
target-language independent and documented here.

The attribute can also take several forms, each defining a different
relationship between a Dafny name and a target language name. In the
form [`{:extern}`](#sec-extern), the name of the external definition is
assumed to be the name of the Dafny declaration after some
target-specific name mangling. However, because naming conventions (and
the set of allowed identifiers) vary between languages, Dafny allows
additional forms for the `{:extern}` attribute.

The form `{:extern <s1>}` instructs `dafny` to compile references to most
declarations using the name `s1` instead of the Dafny name. For [opaque
types](#sec-abstract-types), however, `s1` is sometimes used as a hint as
to how to declare that type when compiling. This hint is interpreted
differently by each compiler.

Finally, the form `{:extern <s1>, <s2>}` instructs `dafny` to use `s2` as
the direct name of the declaration. `dafny` will typically use a
combination of `s1` and `s2`, such as `s1.s2`, to reference the
declaration. It may also be the case that one of the arguments is simply
ignored, depending on the target language.

The recommended style is to prefer `{:extern}` when possible, and use
similar names across languages. This is usually feasible because
existing external code is expected to have the same interface as the
code that `dafny` would generate for a declaration of that form. Because
many Dafny types compile down to custom types defined in the Dafny
runtime library, it's typically necessary to write wrappers by hand that
encapsulate existing external code using a compatible interface, and
those wrappers can have names chosen for compatibility. For example,
retrieving the list of command line arguments when compiling to C\#
requires a wrapper such as the following:

```cs
using icharseq = Dafny.ISequence<char>;
using charseq = Dafny.Sequence<char>;

namespace Externs_Compile {
  public partial class __default {
    public static Dafny.ISequence<icharseq> GetCommandLineArgs() {
      var dafnyArgs = Environment
                      .GetCommandLineArgs()
                      .Select(charseq.FromString);
      return Dafny.Sequence<icharseq>.FromArray(dafnyArgs.ToArray());
    }
}
```

This serves as an example of implementing an extern,
but was only necessary to retrieve command line arguments historically,
as `dafny` now supports capturing these arguments via a main method
that accepts a `seq<string>` (see the section on the [Main method](#sec-user-guide-main)).

Note that `dafny` does not check the arguments to `{:extern}`, so it is
the user's responsibility to ensure that the provided names result in
code that is well-formed in the target language.

Also note that the interface the external code needs to implement
may be affected by compilation flags. In this case, if `--unicode-char:true`
is provided, `dafny` will compile its `char` type to the `Dafny.Rune`
C# type instead, so the references to the C# type `char` above
would need to be changed accordingly. The reference to `charseq.FromString`
would in turn need to be changed to `charseq.UnicodeFromString` to
return the correct type.

Most declarations, including those for modules, classes, traits, member
variables, constructors, methods, function methods, and abstract types,
can be marked with `{:extern}`.

Marking a module with `{:extern}` indicates that the declarations
contained within can be found within the given module, namespace, package, or
similar construct within the target language. Some members of the Dafny
module may contain definitions, in which case code for those definitions
will be generated. Whether this results in valid target code may depend
on some target language support for something resembling "partial"
modules, where different subsets of the contents are defined in
different places.

The story for classes is similar. Code for a class will be generated
if any of its members are not `{:extern}`. Depending on the target
language, making either all or none of the members `{:extern}` may be
the only options that result in valid target code. Traits with
`{:extern}` can refer to existing traits or interfaces in the target
language, or can refer to the interfaces of existing classes.

Member variables marked with `{:extern}` refer to fields or properties
in existing target-language code. Constructors, methods, and functions
refer to the equivalent concepts in the target language. They
can have contracts, which are then assumed to hold for the existing
target-language code. They can also have bodies, but the bodies will not
be compiled in the presence of the `{:extern}` attribute. Bodies can
still be used for reasoning, however, so may be valuable in some cases,
especially for function methods.

Types marked with `{:extern}` must be opaque. The name argument, if any,
usually refers to the type name in the target language, but some
compilers treat it differently.

Detailed description of the `dafny build` and `dafny run` commands and 
the `--input` option (needed when `dafny run` has more than one input file)
is contained [in the section on command-line structure](#command-line).

### 13.7.2. C\#

For a simple Dafny-only program, the translation step converts a `A.dfy` file into `A.cs`;
the build step then produces a `A.dll`, which can be used as a library or as an executable (run using `dotnet A.dll`).

It is also possible to run the dafny files as part of a `csproj` project, with these steps:
- create a dotnet project file with the command `dotnet new console`
- delete the `Program.cs` file
- build the dafny program: `dafny build A.dfy`
- run the built program `dotnet A.dll`

The last two steps can be combined:
`dafny run A.dfy`

Note that all input `.dfy` files and any needed runtime library code are combined into a single `.cs` file, 
which is then compiled by `dotnet` to a `.dll`.


Examples of how to integrate C# libraries and source code with Dafny source code
are contained in [this separate document](integration-cs/IntegrationCS).

### 13.7.3. Java

The Dafny-to-Java compiler translation phase writes out the translated files of a file _A_`.dfy`
to a directory _A_`-java`. 
The build phase writes out a library or executable jar file.
The `--output` option (`-out` in the legacy CLI) can be used to choose a
different jar file path and name and correspondingly different directory for .java and .class files. 

The compiler produces a single wrapper method that then calls classes in 
relevant other `.java` files. Because Java files must be named consistent
with the class they contain, but Dafny files do not, there may be no relation
between the Java file names and the Dafny file names.
However, the wrapper class that contains the Java `main` method is named for
the first `.dfy` file on the command-line.

The step of compiling Java files (using `javac`) requires the Dafny runtime library. 
That library is automatically included if dafny is doing the compilation,
but not if dafny is only doing translation.

Examples of how to integrate Java source code and libraries with Dafny source
are contained in [this separate document](integration-java/IntegrationJava).

### 13.7.4. Javascript

The Dafny-to-Javascript compiler translates all the given `.dfy` files into a single `.js` file, 
which can then be run using `node`. (Javascript has no compilation step). 
The build and run steps are simply
- `dafny build --target:js A.dfy`
- `node A.js`

Or, in one step,
- `dafny run A.dfy`

Examples of how to integrate Javascript libraries and source code with Dafny source
are contained in [this separate document](integration-js/IntegrationJS).

### 13.7.5. Go

The Dafny-to-Go compiler translates all the given `.dfy` files into a single
`.go` file in `A-go/src/A.go`; the output folder can be specified with the 
`-out` option. For an input file `A.dfy` the default output folder is `A-go`. 
Then, Dafny compiles this program and creates an `A.exe` executable in the same folder as `A.dfy`.
Some system runtime code is also placed in `A-go/src`.
The build and run steps are
- `dafny build --target:go A.dfy`
- `./A`

The uncompiled code can be compiled and run by `go` itself using
- ``(cd A-go; GO111MODULE=auto GOPATH=`pwd` go run src/A.go)``

The one-step process is
- `dafny run --target:go A.dfy`

The `GO111MODULE` variable is used because Dafny translates to pre-module Go code.
When the implementation changes to current Go, the above command-line will
change, though the `./A` alternative will still be supported.

Examples of how to integrate Go source code and libraries with Dafny source
are contained in [this separate document](integration-go/IntegrationGo).

### 13.7.6. Python

The Dafny-to-Python compiler is still under development. However, simple
Dafny programs can be built and run as follows. The Dafny-to-Python
compiler translates the `.dfy` files into a single `.py` file along with 
supporting runtime library code, all placed in the output location 
(`A-py` for an input file A.dfy, by default).

The build and run steps are
- `dafny build --target:py A.dfy`
- `python A-py/A.py`

In one step:
- `dafny run --target:py A.dfy`

Examples of how to integrate Python libraries and source code with Dafny source
are contained in [this separate document](integration-py/IntegrationPython).

### 13.7.7. C++

The C++ backend was written assuming that it would primarily support writing
C/C++ style code in Dafny, which leads to some limitations in the current
implementation.

- The C++ compiler does not support BigIntegers, so do not use `int`, or raw instances of
  `arr.Length`, or sequence length, etc. in executable code.  You can however,
  use `arr.Length as uint64` if you can prove your array is an appropriate
  size.  The compiler will report inappropriate integer use.
- The C++ compiler does not support advanced Dafny features like traits or coinductive
  types.
- There is very limited support for higher order functions even for array initialization.  Use
  extern definitions like newArrayFill (see 
  [extern.dfy](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/Test/c++/extern.dfy)) or
  similar.  See also the example in [`functions.dfy`]
  (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/Test/c++/functions.dfy).
- The current backend also assumes the use of C++17 in order to cleanly and
  performantly implement datatypes.

### 13.7.8. Supported features by target language {#sec-supported-features-by-target-language}

Some Dafny features are not supported by every target language.
The table below shows which features are supported by each backend.
An empty cell indicates that a feature is not supported,
while an X indicates that it is.

## 13.8. Dafny Command Line Options {#sec-command-line-options}

There are many command-line options to the `dafny` tool.
The most current documentation of the options is within the tool itself,
using the `-?` or `--help` or `-h` options.

Remember that options are typically stated with either a leading `--`.

Legacy options begin with either '-' or '/'; however they are being
migrated to the POSIX-compliant `--` form as needed.

### 13.8.1. Help and version information {#sec-controlling-help}

These options emit general information about commands, options and attributes.
When present, the dafny program will terminates after emitting the requested information
but without processig any files.

* `--help`, `-h` - shows the various commands (which have help information under them as `dafny <command> -h`

* `--version` - show the version of the build

Legacy options:

* `-?` - print out the legacy list of command-line options
  and terminate. All of these options are also described in this and
  the following sections.

* `-attrHelp` - print out the current list of supported attribute
  declarations and terminate.

* `-env:<n>` - print the command-line arguments supplied to the program.
  The value of `<n>` can be one of the following.

  * `0` - never print command-line arguments.

  * `1` (default) - print them to Boogie (`.bpl`) files and prover logs.

  * `2` - operate like with option `1` but also print to standard output.

* `-wait` - wait for the user to press `Enter` before terminating after a successful execution.

### 13.8.2. Controlling input {#sec-controlling-input}

These options control how Dafny processes its input.

* `-stdin` - read standard input and treat it as Dafny source code,
  instead of reading from a file.

* `--library:<files>` - treat the given files as _library_ code, namely, skip
these files (and any files recursively included) during verification;
the value may be a comma-separated-list of files or folders; folders are expanded into
a list of all .dfy files contained, recursively, in those folders

* `--prelude:<file>` (was `-dprelude`) - select an alternative Dafny prelude file. This
  file contains Boogie definitions (including many axioms) required by
  the translator from Dafny to Boogie. Using an alternative prelude is
  primarily useful if you're extending the Dafny language or changing
  how Dafny constructs are modeled. The default prelude is 
  [here](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/Source/Dafny/DafnyPrelude.bpl).

### 13.8.3. Controlling plugins {#sec-controlling-plugins}

Dafny has a plugin capability. 
A plugin has access to an AST of the dafny input files
after all parsing and resolution are performed (but not verification)
and also to the command-line options.

This facility is still _experimental_ and very much in flux, particularly 
the form of the AST. The best guides to writing a new plugin are
(a) the documentation in [the section of this manual on plugins](#sec-plugins) 
and (b) example plugins in the
`src/Tools` folder of the `dafny-lang/compiler-bootstrap` repo.

The value of the option `--plugin` is a path to a dotnet dll that contains
the compiled plugin.

### 13.8.4. Controlling output {#sec-controlling-output}

These options instruct Dafny to print various information about your
program during processing, including variations of the original source
code (which can be helpful for debugging).

* `--use-basename-for-filename` - when enabled, just the filename without the 
directory path is used in error messages; this make error message shorter and 
not tied to the local environment (which is a help in testing)

* `--output`, `-o` - location of output files [translate, build]

* `--show-snippets` - include with an error message some of the source code text
in the neighborhood of the error; the error location (file, line, column) is always given

* `--solver-log <file>` - [verification only] the file in which to place the SMT text sent to the solver

* `--log-format <configuration>` - [verification only] (was `-verificationLogger:<configuration string>`)
  log verification
  results to the given test result logger. The currently supported
  loggers are `trx`, `csv`, and `text`. These are the XML-based formats
  commonly used for test results for .NET languages, a custom CSV
  schema, and a textual format meant for human consumption,
  respectively. You can provide configuration using the same string
  format as when using the `--logger` option for dotnet test, such as:

        -verificationLogger:trx;LogFileName=<...>

  The exact mapping of verification concepts to these formats is
  experimental and subject to change!

  The `trx` and `csv` loggers automatically choose an output file name
  by default, and print the name of this file to the console. The `text`
  logger prints its output to the console by default, but can send
  output to a file given the `LogFileName` option.

  The `text` logger also includes a more detailed breakdown of what
  assertions appear in each assertion batch. When combined with the
  `-vcsSplitOnEveryAssert` option, it will provide approximate time and
  resource use costs for each assertion, allowing identification of
  especially expensive assertions.


Legacy options:

* `-stats` - print various statistics about the Dafny files supplied on
  the command line. The statistics include the number of total
  functions, recursive functions, total methods, ghost methods, classes,
  and modules. They also include the maximum call graph width and the
  maximum module height.

* `-dprint:<file>` - print the Dafny program after parsing (use `-` for
  `<file>` to print to the console).

* `-rprint:<file>` - print the Dafny program after type resolution (use
  `-` for `<file>` to print to the console).

* `-printMode:<Everything|DllEmbed|NoIncludes|NoGhost>` - select what to
  include in the output requested by `-dprint` or `-rprint`. The
  argument can be one of the following.

  * `Everything` (default) - include everything.

  * `DllEmbed`- print the source that will be included in a compiled DLL.

  * `NoIncludes` - disable printing of methods incorporated via the
    include mechanism that have the `{:verify false}` attribute, as well
    as datatypes and fields included from other files.

  * `NoGhost` - disables printing of functions, ghost methods, and proof
    statements in implementation methods. Also disable anything
    `NoIncludes` disables.

* `-printIncludes:<None|Immediate|Transitive>` - select what information
  from included files to incorporate into the output selected by
  `-dprint` or `-rprint`. The argument can be one of the following.

  * `None` (default) - don't print anything from included files.

  * `Immediate` - print files directly included by files specified on
    the command line. Exit after printing.

  * `Transitive` - print files transitively included by files specified
    on the command line. Exit after printing.

* `-view:<view1, view2>` - this option limits what is printed by /rprint
  for a module to the names that are part of the given export set;
  the option argument is a comma-separated list of fully-qualified export
  set names.

* `-funcCallGraph` - print out the function call graph. Each line has
  the format `func,mod=callee*`, where `func` is the name of a function,
  `mod` is the name of its containing module, and `callee*` is a
  space-separated list of the functions that `func` calls.

* `--show-snippets` (was `-showSnippets:<n>` ) - show a source code snippet for each Dafny
  message. The legacy option was `-showSnippets` with values 0 and 1 for false and true.


* `-printTooltips` - dump additional positional information (displayed
  as mouse-over tooltips by LSP clients) to standard output as `Info`
  messages.

* `-pmtrace` - print debugging information from the pattern-match
  compiler.

* `-titrace` - print debugging information during the type inference
  process.

* `-diagnosticsFormat:<text|json>` - control how to report errors, warnings, and info
  messages.  `<fmt>` may be one of the following:

  * `text` (default): Report diagnostics in human-readable format.
  * `json`: Report diagnostics in JSON format, one object per diagnostic, one
    diagnostic per line.  Info-level messages are only included with
    `-printTooltips`.  End positions are only included with `-showSnippets:1`.
    Diagnostics are the following format (but without newlines):

    ```json
    {
      "location": {
        "filename": "xyz.dfy",
        "range": { // Start and (optional) end of diagnostic
          "start": {
            "pos": 83, // 0-based character offset in input
            "line": 6, // 1-based line number
            "character": 0 // 0-based column number
          },
          "end": { "pos": 86, "line": 6, "character": 3 }
        }
      },
      "severity": 2, // 1: error; 2: warning; 4: info
      "message": "module-level const declarations are always non-instance ...",
      "source": "Parser",
      "relatedInformation": [ // Additional messages, if any
        {
          "location": { ... }, // Like above
          "message": "...",
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### 13.8.5. Controlling language features {#sec-controlling-language}

These options allow some Dafny language features to be enabled or
disabled. Some of these options exist for backward compatibility with
older versions of Dafny.

* `--function-syntax` (value '3' or '4') - permits a choice of using the Dafny 3 syntax (`function` and `function method`)
or the Dafny 4 syntax (`ghost function` and `function`)

* `--quantifier-syntax` (value '3' or '4') - permits a choice between the Dafny 3 and Dafny 4 syntax for quantifiers

* `--unicode-char` - if false, the `char` type represents any UTF-16 code unit,
  that is, any 16-bit value, including surrogate code points and
  allows `\uXXXX` escapes in string and character literals.
  If true, `char` represnts any Unicode scalar value,
  that is, any Unicode code point excluding surrogates and
  allows `\U{X..X}` escapes in string and character literals. 
  The default is false for Dafny version 3 and true for version 4.
  The legacy option was `-unicodeChar:<n>` with values 0 and 1 for
  false and true above.

Legacy options:

* `-noIncludes` - ignore `include` directives in the program.

* `-noExterns` - ignore `extern` attributes in the program.

<a id="sec-function-syntax"/>

* `--function-syntax:<version>` (was `-functionSyntax:<version>` ) - select what function syntax to
  recognize. The syntax for functions is changing from Dafny version 3
  to version 4. This switch gives early access to the new syntax, and
  also provides a mode to help with migration. The valid arguments
  include the following.

  * `3` (default) - compiled functions are written `function method` and
    `predicate method`. Ghost functions are written `function` and
    `predicate`.

  * `4` - compiled functions are written `function` and `predicate`.
    Ghost functions are written `ghost function` and `ghost predicate`.

  * `migration3to4` - compiled functions are written `function method`
    and `predicate method`. Ghost functions are written `ghost function`
    and `ghost predicate`. To migrate from version 3 to version 4, use
    this flag on your version 3 program to flag all occurrences of
    `function` and `predicate` as parsing errors. These are ghost
    functions, so change those into the new syntax `ghost function` and
    `ghost predicate`. Then, start using \
    `-functionSyntax:4`. This will
    flag all occurrences of `function method` and `predicate method` as
    parsing errors. So, change those to just `function` and `predicate`.
    As a result, your program will use version 4 syntax and have the
    same meaning as your previous version 3 program.

  * `experimentalDefaultGhost` - like `migration3to4`, but allow
    `function` and `predicate` as alternatives to declaring ghost
    functions and predicates, respectively

  * `experimentalDefaultCompiled` - like `migration3to4`, but allow
    `function` and `predicate` as alternatives to declaring compiled
    functions and predicates, respectively

  * `experimentalPredicateAlwaysGhost` - compiled functions are written
    `function`. Ghost functions are written `ghost function`. Predicates
    are always ghost and are written `predicate`.

  This option can also be set locally (at the module level) using the `:options`
  attribute:

<!-- %check-verify -->
  ```dafny
  module {:options "--function-syntax:4"} M {
    predicate CompiledPredicate() { true }
  }
  ```

* `--quantifier-syntax:<version>` (was `-quantifierSyntax:<version>` ) - select what quantifier syntax to recognize.
    The syntax for quantification domains is changing from Dafny version 3 to version 4,
    more specifically where quantifier ranges (`| <Range>`) are allowed.
    This switch gives early access to the new syntax.

    * `3` (default) - Ranges are only allowed after all quantified variables are declared.
        (e.g. `set x, y | 0 <= x < |s| && y in s[x] && 0 <= y :: y`)
    * `4` - Ranges are allowed after each quantified variable declaration.
        (e.g. `set x | 0 <= x < |s|, y <- s[x] | 0 <= y :: y`)

    Note that quantifier variable domains (`<- <Domain>`) are available
    in both syntax versions.

* `-disableScopes` - treat all export sets as `export reveal *` to never
    hide function bodies or type definitions during translation.

* `-allowsGlobals` - allow the implicit class `_default` to contain
  fields, instance functions, and instance methods. These class members
  are declared at the module scope, outside of explicit classes. This
  command-line option is provided to simplify a transition from the
  behavior in the language prior to version 1.9.3, from which point
  onward all functions and methods declared at the module scope are
  implicitly static and field declarations are not allowed at the
  module scope.

### 13.8.6. Controlling warnings {#sec-controlling-warnings}

These options control what warnings Dafny produces, and whether to treat
warnings as errors.

* `--warn-as-errors` (was `-warningsAsErrors`) - treat warnings as errors.

* `--warn-shadowing` (was `-warnShadowing`) - emit a warning if the name 
  of a declared variable caused another variable to be shadowed.

* `--warn-missing-constructor-parentheses` - warn if a constructor name in a pattern might be misinterpreted

Legacy options

* `-deprecation:<n>` - control warnings about deprecated features. The
  value of `<n>` can be any of the following.

   * `0` - don't issue any warnings.

   * `1` (default) - issue warnings.

   * `2` - issue warnings and advise about alternate syntax.

### 13.8.7. Controlling verification {#sec-controlling-verification}

These options control how Dafny verifies the input program, including
how much it verifies, what techniques it uses to perform verification,
and what information it produces about the verification process.

* `--no-verify` - turns off verification (for translate, build, run commands)

* `--verify-included-files` (was `-verifyAllModules`) - verify modules that come from include directives.

  By default, Dafny only verifies files explicitly listed on the command
  line: if `a.dfy` includes `b.dfy`, a call to `Dafny a.dfy` will detect
  and report verification errors from `a.dfy` but not from `b.dfy`.

  With this option, Dafny will instead verify everything: all input
  modules and all their transitive dependencies. This way `Dafny a.dfy`
  will verify `a.dfy` and all files that it includes (here `b.dfy`), as
  well all files that these files include, etc.

  Running Dafny with this option on the file containing your
  main result is a good way to ensure that all its dependencies verify.


* `--track-print-effects` - If true, a compiled method, constructor, or 
   iterator is allowed to have print effects only if it is marked with 
   {{:print}}. (default false)
   The legacy option was `-trackPrintEffects:<n>`) with values 0 or 1
   for false and true.

* `--relax-definite-assignment` - control the rules governing definite
  assignment, the property that every variable is eventually assigned a
  value before it is used.
  * if false (default), enforce definite-assignment for all non-yield-parameter
    variables and fields, regardless of their types
  * if false and `--enforce-determinism` is true, then also performs 
    checks in the compiler that no nondeterministic statements are used
  * if true, enforce definite-assignment rules for compiled
    variables and fields whose types do not support auto-initialization
    and for ghost variables and fields whose type is possibly empty.

* `--disable-nonlinear-arithmetic` (was `-noNLarith`) - reduce 
  Z3's knowledge of non-linear arithmetic (the
  operators `*`, `/`, and `%`). Enabling this option will typically
  require more manual work to complete proofs (by explicitly applying
  lemmas about non-linear operators), but will also result in more
  predictable behavior, since Z3 can sometimes get stuck down an
  unproductive path while attempting to prove things about those
  operators. (This option will perhaps be replaced by `-arith` in the
  future. For now, it takes precedence over `-arith`.)

* `--manual-lemma-induction` - diables automatic inducntion for lemmas

* `--isolate-assertions` - verify assertions individually

Controlling the proof engine:

* `--cores:<n>` - sets the number or percent of the available cores to be used for verification
* `--verification-time-limit <seconds>` - imposes a time limit on each verification attempt
* `--verification-error-limit <number>` - limits the number of verification errors reported (0 is no limit)
* `--resource-limit` - states a resource limit (to be used by the backend solver)

Legacy options:

* `-dafnyVerify:<n>` [discouraged] - turn verification of the program on or off. The
  value of `<n>` can be any of the following.

  * `0` - stop after type checking.

  * `1` - continue on to verification and compilation.


* `-separateModuleOutput` - output verification results for each module
  separately, rather than aggregating them after they are all finished.

* `-mimicVerificationOf:<dafny version>` - let `dafny` attempt to mimic
  the verification behavior of a previous version of `dafny`. This can be
  useful during migration to a newer version of `dafny` when a Dafny
  program has proofs, such as methods or lemmas, that are highly variable in
  the sense that their verification may become slower or fail altogether
  after logically irrelevant changes are made in the verification input.

  Accepted versions are: `3.3`. Note that falling back on the behavior
  of version 3.3 turns off features that prevent certain classes of
  verification variability.

* `-noCheating:<n>` - control whether certain assumptions are allowed.
  The value of `<n>` can be one of the following.

  * `0` (default) - allow `assume` statements and free invariants.

  * `1` - treat all assumptions as `assert` statements, and drop free
    invariants.

* `-induction:<n>` - control the behavior of induction. The value of
  `<n>` can be one of the following.

  * `0` - never do induction, not even when attributes request it.

  * `1` - apply induction only when attributes request it.

  * `2` - apply induction as requested (by attributes) and also for
    heuristically chosen quantifiers.

  * `3` - apply induction as requested, and for heuristically chosen
    quantifiers and lemmas.

  * `4` (default) - apply induction as requested, and for all lemmas.

* `-inductionHeuristic:<n>` - control the heuristics used for induction.
  The value of `<n>` can be one of the following.

  * `0` - use the least discriminating induction heuristic (that is,
    lean toward applying induction more often).

  * `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5` - use an intermediate heuristic, ordered as
    follows as far as how discriminating they are: 0 < 1 < 2 < (3,4) < 5
    < 6.

  * `6` (default) - use the most discriminating induction heuristic.

* `-allocated:<n>` - specify defaults for where Dafny should assert and
  assume `allocated(x)` for various parameters `x`, local variables `x`,
  bound variables `x`, etc. Lower `<n>` may require more manual
  `allocated(x)` annotations and thus may be more difficult to use. The
  value of `<n>` can be one of the following.

  * `0` - never assume or assert `allocated(x)` by default.

  * `1` - assume `allocated(x)` only for non-ghost variables and fields.
    (These assumptions are free, since non-ghost variables always
    contain allocated values at run-time.) This option may speed up
    verification relative to `-allocated:2`.

  * `2` - assert/assume `allocated(x)` on all variables, even bound
    variables in quantifiers. This option is the easiest to use for code
    that uses the heap heavily.

  * `3` - (default) make frugal use of heap parameters.

  * `4` - like `3` but add `allocated` antecedents when ranges don't imply
    allocatedness.

  Warning: this option should be chosen consistently across an entire
  project; it would be unsound to use different defaults for different
  files or modules within a project. Furthermore, modes `-allocated:0` and
  `-allocated:1` let functions depend on the allocation state, which is
  not sound in general.

* `-noAutoReq` - ignore `autoReq` attributes, and therefore do not
  automatically generate `requires` clauses.

* `-autoReqPrint:<file>` - print the requires clauses that were
  automatically generated by `autoReq` to the given `<file>`.

* `-arith:<n>` - control how arithmetic is modeled during verification.
  This is an experimental switch, and its options may change. The value
  of `<n>` can be one of the following.

  * `0` - use Boogie/Z3 built-ins for all arithmetic operations.

  * `1` (default) - like `0`, but introduce symbolic synonyms for `*`,
    `/`, and `%`, and allow these operators to be used in triggers.

  * `2` - like `1`, but also introduce symbolic synonyms for `+` and
    `-`.

  * `3` - turn off non-linear arithmetic in the SMT solver. Still use
    Boogie/Z3 built-in symbols for all arithmetic operations.

  * `4` - like `3`, but introduce symbolic synonyms for `*`, `/`, and `%`,
    and allow these operators to be used in triggers.

  * `5` - like `4`, but also introduce symbolic synonyms for `+` and
    `-`.

  * `6` - like `5`, and introduce axioms that distribute `+` over `*`.

  * `7` - like `6`, and introduce facts about the associativity of
    literal arguments over `*`.

  * `8` - like `7`, and introduce axioms for the connection between `*`,
    `/`, and `%`.

  * `9` - like `8`, and introduce axioms for sign of multiplication.

  * `10` - like `9`, and introduce axioms for commutativity and
    associativity of `*`.

* `-autoTriggers:<n>` - control automatic generation of `{:trigger}`
  annotations. See [triggers](#sec-trigger). The value of `<n>` can be one
  of the following.

  * `0` - do not generate `{:trigger}` annotations for user-level
    quantifiers.

  * `1` (default) - add a `{:trigger}` annotation to each user-level
    quantifier. Existing annotations are preserved.

* `-rewriteFocalPredicates:<n>` - control rewriting of predicates in the
  body of prefix lemmas. See [the section about nicer extreme proofs](#sec-nicer-proofs-of-extremes).
  The value of `<n>` can be one of the following.

  * `0` - don't rewrite predicates in the body of prefix lemmas.

  * `1` (default) - in the body of prefix lemmas, rewrite any use of a
    focal predicate `P` to `P#[_k-1]`.

* `-extractCounterexample` - control generation of counterexamples. If
  verification fails, report a detailed counterexample for the first
  failing assertion. Requires specifying the `-mv` option, to specify
  where to write the counterexample, as well as the
  `-proverOpt:O:model_compress=false` and
  `-proverOpt:O:model.completion=true` options.

### 13.8.8. Controlling compilation {#sec-controlling-compilation}

These options control what code gets compiled, what target language is
used, how compilation proceeds, and whether the compiled program is
immediately executed.

* `--target:<s>` or `-t:<s>` (was `-compileTarget:<s>`) - set the target programming language for the
  compiler. The value of `<s>` can be one of the following.

   * `cs` - C\# . Produces a .dll file that can be run using `dotnet`.
      For example, `dafny Hello.dfy` will produce `Hello.dll` and `Hello.runtimeconfig.json`.
      The dll can be run using `dotnet Hello.dll`.

   * `go` - Go. The default output of `dafny Hello.dfy -compileTarget:go` is
      in the `Hello-go` folder. It is run using
      ``GOPATH=`pwd`/Hello-go/ GO111MODULE=auto go run Hello-go/src/Hello.go``

   * `js` - Javascript. The default output of `dafny Hello.dfy -compileTarget:js` is
      the file `Hello.js`, which can be run using `node Hello.js`. (You must have 
      `bignumber.js` installed.)

   * `java` - Java. The default output of `dafny Hello.dfy -compileTarget:java` is
      in the `Hello-java` folder. The compiled program can be run using
      `java -cp Hello-java:Hello-java/DafnyRuntime.jar Hello`.

   * `py` - Python. The default output of `dafny Hello.dfy -compileTarget:py` is
      in the `Hello-py` folder. The compiled program can be run using
      `python Hello-py/Hello.py`, where `python` is Python version 3.

   * `cpp` - C++. The default output of `dafny Hello.dfy -compileTarget:cpp` is
      `Hello.exe` and other files written to the current folder. The compiled
      program can be run using `./Hello.exe`.

* `--input <file>` - designates files to be include in the compilation in addition to the main file in
  `dafny run`; these may be non-.dfy files; this option may be specified more than once

* `--output:<file>` or `-o:<file>` (was `-out:<file>`) - set the name to use for compiled code files.

By default, `dafny` reuses the name of the Dafny file being compiled.
Compilers that generate a single file use the file name as-is (e.g. the
C# backend will generate `<file>.dll` and optionally `<file>.cs` with
`-spillTargetCode`). Compilers that generate multiple files use the file
name as a directory name (e.g. the Java backend will generate files in
directory `<file>-java/`). Any file extension is ignored, so
`-out:<file>` is the same as `-out:<file>.<ext>` if `<file>` contains no
periods.

* `--include-runtime` - include the runtime library for the target language in
  the generated artifacts. This is true by default for build and run, 
  but false by default for translate. The legacy option `-useRuntimeLib` had the 
  opposite effect: when enabled, the compiled assembly referred to
  the pre-built `DafnyRuntime.dll` in the
  compiled assembly rather than including `DafnyRuntime.cs` in the build
  process. 


Legacy options:

* `-compile:<n>` -  [obsolete - use `dafny build` or `dafny run`] control whether compilation 
   happens. The value of
  `<n>` can be one of the following. Note that if the program is 
   compiled, it will be compiled to the target language determined by
   the `-compileTarget` option, which is C\# by default.

   * `0` - do not compile the program

   * `1` (default) - upon successful verification, compile the program
     to the target language.

   * `2` - always compile, regardless of verification success.

   * `3` - if verification is successful, compile the program (like
     option `1`), and then if there is a `Main` method, attempt to run the
     program.

   * `4` - always compile (like option `2`), and then if there is a
     `Main` method, attempt to run the program.

* `-spillTargetCode:<n>` - [obsolete - use `dafny translate`) control whether to write out compiled code in
  the target language (instead of just holding it in internal temporary
  memory). The value of `<n>` can be one of the following.

   * `0` (default) - don't make any extra effort to write the textual
     target program (but still compile it, if `-compile` indicates to do
     so).

   * `1` - write it out to the target language, if it is being compiled.

   * `2` - write the compiled program if it passes verification,
     regardless of the `-compile` setting.

   * `3` - write the compiled program regardless of verification success
     and the `-compile` setting.

Note that some compiler targets may (always or in some situations) write
out the textual target program as part of compilation, in which case
`-spillTargetCode:0` behaves the same way as `-spillTargetCode:1`.

* `-Main:<name>` - specify the (fully-qualified) name of the method to
  use as the executable entry point. The default is the method with the
  `{:main}` attribute, or else the method named `Main`.

* `-compileVerbose:<n>` - control whether to write out compilation
  progress information. The value of `<n>` can be one of the following.

  * `0` - do not print any information (silent mode)

  * `1` (default) - print information such as the files being created by
    the compiler

* `-coverage:<file>` - emit branch-coverage calls and outputs into
  `<file>`, including a legend that gives a description of each
  source-location identifier used in the branch-coverage calls. (Use `-`
  as `<file>` to print to the console.)

* `-optimize` - produce optimized C# code by passing the `/optimize`
  flag to the `csc` executable.

* `-optimizeResolution:<n>` - control optimization of method target
  resolution. The value of `<n>` can be one of the following.

  * `0` - resolve and translate all methods.

  * `1` - translate methods only in the call graph of the current
    verification target.

  * `2` (default) - as in `1`, but resolve only methods that are defined
    in the current verification target file, not in included files.


* `-testContracts:<mode>` - test certain function and method contracts
  at runtime. This works by generating a wrapper for each function or
  method to be tested that includes a sequence of `expect` statements
  for each requires clause, a call to the original, and sequence of
  `expect` statements for each `ensures` clause. This is particularly
  useful for code marked with the `{:extern}` attribute and implemented
  in the target language instead of Dafny. Having runtime checks of the
  contracts on such code makes it possible to gather evidence that the
  target-language code satisfies the assumptions made of it during Dafny
  verification through mechanisms ranging from manual tests through
  fuzzing to full verification. For the latter two use cases, having
  checks for `requires` clauses can be helpful, even if the Dafny
  calling code will never violate them.

  The `<mode>` parameter can currently be one of the following.

  * `Externs` - insert dynamic checks when calling any function or
    method marked with the `{:extern}` attribute, wherever the call
    occurs.

  * `TestedExterns` - insert dynamic checks when calling any function or
    method marked with the `{:extern}` attribute directly from a
    function or method marked with the `{:test}` attribute.

### 13.8.9. Controlling Boogie {#sec-controlling-boogie}

Dafny builds on top of Boogie, a general-purpose intermediate language
for verification. Options supported by Boogie on its own are also
supported by Dafny. Some of the Boogie options most relevant to Dafny
users include the following. We use the term "procedure" below to refer
to a Dafny function, lemma, method, or predicate, following Boogie
terminology.

* `--solver-path` - specifies a custom SMT solver to use

* `--solver-plugin` - specifies a plugin to use as the SMT solver, instead of an external pdafny translaterocess

* `--boogie-filter` - restricts the set of verification tasks (for debugging) 

* `--boogie` - arguments to send to boogie

Legacy options:

* `-proc:<name>` - verify only the procedure named `<name>`. The name
  can include `*` to indicate arbitrary sequences of characters.

* `-trace` - print extra information during verification, including
  timing, resource use, and outcome for each procedure incrementally, as
  verification finishes.

* `-randomSeed:<n>` - turn on randomization of the input that Boogie
  passes to the SMT solver and turn on randomization in the SMT solver
  itself.

  Certain Boogie inputs cause proof variability in the sense that changes to the
  input that preserve its meaning may cause the output to change. The
  `-randomSeed` option simulates meaning-preserving changes to the
  input without requiring the user to actually make those changes.

  The `-randomSeed` option is implemented by renaming variables and
  reordering declarations in the input, and by setting
  solver options that have similar effects.

* `-randomSeedIterations:<n>` - attempt to prove each VC `<n>` times
  with `<n>` random seeds. If `-randomSeed` has been provided, each
  proof attempt will use a new random seed derived from this original
  seed. If not, it will implicitly use `-randomSeed:0` to ensure a
  difference between iterations. This option can be very useful for
  identifying input programs for which verification is highly variable. If the
  verification times or solver resource counts associated with each
  proof attempt vary widely for a given procedure, small changes to that
  procedure might be more likely to cause proofs to fail in the future.

* `-vcsSplitOnEveryAssert` - prove each (explicit or implicit) assertion
  in each procedure separately. See also the attribute
  [`{:vcs_split_on_every_assert}`](#sec-vcs_split_on_every_assert) for
  restricting this option on specific procedures. By default, Boogie
  attempts to prove that every assertion in a given procedure holds all
  at once, in a single query to an SMT solver. This usually performs
  well, but sometimes causes the solver to take longer. If a proof that
  you believe should succeed is timing out, using this option can
  sometimes help.

* `-timeLimit:<n>` - spend at most `<n>` seconds attempting to prove any
  single SMT query. This setting can also be set per method using the
  attribute [`{:timeLimit n}`](#sec-time-limit).

* `-rlimit:<n>` - set the maximum solver resource count to use while
  proving a single SMT query. This can be a more deterministic approach
  than setting a time limit. To choose an appropriate value, please
  refer to the documentation of the attribute [`{:rlimit}`](#sec-rlimit)
  that can be applied per procedure.

* `-print:<file>` - print the translation of the Dafny file to a Boogie file.

If you have Boogie installed locally, you can run the printed Boogie file with the following script:

```bash
DOTNET=$(which dotnet)

BOOGIE_ROOT="path/to/boogie/Source"
BOOGIE="$BOOGIE_ROOT/BoogieDriver/bin/Debug/net6.0/BoogieDriver.dll"

if [[ ! -x "$DOTNET" ]]; then
    echo "Error: Dafny requires .NET Core to run on non-Windows systems."
    exit 1
fi

#Uncomment if you prefer to use the executable instead of the DLL
#BOOGIE=$(which boogie)

BOOGIE_OPTIONS="/infer:j"
PROVER_OPTIONS="\
  /proverOpt:O:auto_config=false \
  /proverOpt:O:type_check=true \
  /proverOpt:O:smt.case_split=3 \
  /proverOpt:O:smt.qi.eager_threshold=100 \
  /proverOpt:O:smt.delay_units=true \
  /proverOpt:O:smt.arith.solver=2 \
  "

"$DOTNET" "$BOOGIE" $BOOGIE_OPTIONS $PROVER_OPTIONS "$@"
#Uncomment if you want to use the executable instead of the DLL
#"$BOOGIE" $BOOGIE_OPTIONS $PROVER_OPTIONS "$@"
```

### 13.8.10. Controlling the prover {#sec-controlling-prover}

Much of controlling the prover is accomplished by controlling 
verification condition generation ([25.9.7](#sec-controlling-verification)) or Boogie 
([Section 13.8.9](#sec-controlling-boogie)). 
The following options are also commonly used:

* `--verification-error-limit:<n>` - limits the number of verification errors reported per procedure.
  Default is 5; 0 means as many as possible; a small positive number runs faster
  but a large positive number reports more errors per run

* `--verification-time-limit:<n>` (was `-timeLimit:<n>`) - limits 
  the number of seconds spent trying to verify each procedure.


### 13.8.11. Controlling test generation {#sec-controlling-test-gen}

Dafny is capable of generating unit (runtime) tests. It does so by asking the prover to solve
for values of inputs to a method that cause the program to execute specific blocks or paths.
A detailed description of how to do this is given in
[a separate document](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/Source/DafnyTestGeneration/README.md).
