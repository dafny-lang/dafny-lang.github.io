## Question

How do I create a new empty map (or set or sequence)?

## Answer

An empty sequence is denoted by `[]`, an empty set by `{}`, an empty multiset by `multiset{}`,  and an empty map by
`map[]`. The type of the empty collection is typically inferred from its subsequent use.

The various operations on values of these types are described [in the reference manual section on Collection Types](../DafnyRef/DafnyRef#sec-collection-types).
