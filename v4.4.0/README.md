## Snapshots of documentation

The current development work and git history of documentation is in the 
`dafny-lang/dafny` repository, in the `docs` folder.

The `dafny-lang/dafny.github.io` repo is the target for `https://dafny.org` 
and is the entry point to all the user-facing documentation about Dafny.

At the top-level is just the index.html landing page, supporting files 
(e.g., images) and files needed for the Github markdown translation.

Sub-folders contain _snapshots_ of the Dafny documentation at the time of 
each release (beginning with 3.9.0). 
Each snapshot is in its own folder, e.g. dafny.org/vX.Y.Z, with `latest` 
containing the most recent, and `dev` redirecting to the development docs.
