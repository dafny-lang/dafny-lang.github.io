## Question

Is there a Dafny style? and a Dafny linter (style checker and bad smell warnings)?

## Answer

There is a Dafny style guide [here](https://dafny.org/dafny/StyleGuide/Style-Guide).

There is not yet a Dafny lint tool (that is, warnings about technically correct but suspicious or poor-style code),
though a formatter is underway. Warnings about some matters are included in the Dafny parser. 
However, ideas for lint warnings are being collected and you are welcome to contribute ideas: suggestions can be made on the [issues list](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/issues).
